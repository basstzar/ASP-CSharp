<!--
1.	Why do the nested DIVs (DIV F and DIV H) look different? Why are they different widths and appear to be in different positions? What caused this behavior?

*The widths are different because the absolute positioning on DIV H results in the borders collapsing on the "DIV H" text.  Absolute positioning removes the element from the normal flow resulting in changed position behavior.

2.	What happens if 'DIV G' is just a container div without any content?  (To test, remove or comment out everything between the opening and closing <div> tags for 'DIV G' from the code and see. 
    Refresh your web page. Be sure to replace it before you submit.) What do you see? What occurred and why?

* DIV G collapsed.  This occurs because of absolute positioning.  

3.	What did you expect the bottom margin to do? Did it apply as you expected? Why or why not? To test, comment out the CSS rules for margin and view. 

* They would have no visible effect as they would create a margin below the divs.  Any block elements coming below them in normal flow would show the margin.  

4.	What differences did you see when you viewed the page in Chrome, IE9, and Firefox? Be descriptive â€“ remember, I can't see what you saw.

* Firefox - Appears as shown in example. IE - Divs 2, 5, and 6 appeared to be positioned significantly lower than Firefox. Chrome Divs 2, 5, and 6 appeared to be positioned slightly lower than Firefox
